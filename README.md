Day 2:
----------
Milestones:
1. Finished the Anaconda Lecture of Lesson 1: Introduction to Deep Learning. I successfully updated my anaconda distribution and downloaded pertinent packages per coursework in the next Applying Deep Learning chapter.
2. Generated style transfers using my image as content image.

3. Recently tried the Deep Traffic self driving car simulation. What I did was to adjust the lanesside to 2, patchesAhead to 3 while retaining patchesBehind to 0. I also created layer definitions, a total of 3 started at 256 number of neurons, to 128 and then 32. Ultimately, after training, I got a fair 64.54 mph on average. 
4. Explored a simulation of Reinforcement Learning applied autonomously in Flappy Bird game.

Day 1:
----------
Halfway into finishing the introduction to deep learning lesson of the Deep Learning Nanodegree.

I was late in starting the course. But as the old saying goes, it is better late than never. I am committed into finishing 30DaysofUdacity initiative from this day forward and I hope to dedicate at least 15 hours per week to my learning journey.
