Day 7:
----------
This is my first week in the nanodegree and it has been a rewarding experience by far.
Milestones:
1. Finished, submitted and passed the first project Predicting Bike-Sharing Data. I got a training loss of 0.071 and validation of 0.155. I am now awaiting for code review.

2. Watched the history of AI and Deep Learning visual podcast by Frank Chen where he explained how AI visions became fruitful on the present years from the summer of 1952, to AI winters, to breakthroughs in deep learning to the advances in Machine Learning products that we enjoy right now. I am glad that I watched this video. It feels like I am heading into the right direction of investing my time and efforts to learn this domain to produce systems enhanced with AI components.

Day 6:
----------
Milestones:
1. Finally, I finished the Implementing Gradient Descent lesson. It is so much fun. This really reinforces the value of theoretical/mathematical intuition as before utilizing much more complicated deep learning methods. I probably need to review this again.
2. Watched Andrej Karpathy's [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59Hbtz7XgjM) about the importance of building the intuition behind backpropagation and gradient descent. 
3. Gone through the first project implementation (Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns). Unfortunately, my validation error is 0.64. I probably need to review my implementation before submitting it. This is a challenging yet rewarding project at the same time.

Day 5:
----------
Milestones:
1. I am halfway into finishing implementing gradient descent from scratch. I failed to finish it this time but I will surely finish them tomorrow.
2. I have been brushing up my skills in multivariable calculus and been watching several KhanAcademy videos in the process.

Day 4:
----------
Milestones:
1. Finished 67% of the Neural Network lesson. Most of the content that I had gone through were from the Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch but I reviewed them anyway. It is really interesting how neural networks can be effectively learned through engaging visuals. I am loving it so far.
2. I had started learning how to implement gradient descent using NumPy and will finish the module tomorrow.

Day 3:
----------
Milestones:
1. Finished the whole first lesson: Introduction to Deep Learning.
2. I reviewed Jupyter Notebook and read the amazing and inspiring article about LIGO's journey in proving Einstein's theory a century ago - link [here](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211). It is really incredible how open source Jupyter notebook that I used on several courseworks is also the tool that US research agencies used to communicate a massive feat. 
3. Went through the Matrix Math and Numpy Refresher. I received multiple lessons like that before. But Udacity's way of telling a story in an engaging and visual way helped me solidify the concept of matrix factorization even better. Loving every part of it.

Day 2:
----------
Milestones:
1. Finished the Anaconda Lecture of Lesson 1: Introduction to Deep Learning. I successfully updated my anaconda distribution and downloaded pertinent packages per coursework in the next Applying Deep Learning chapter.
2. Generated style transfers using my image as content image.

3. Recently tried the Deep Traffic self driving car simulation. What I did was to adjust the lanesside to 2, patchesAhead to 3 while retaining patchesBehind to 0. I also created layer definitions, a total of 3 started at 256 number of neurons, to 128 and then 32. Ultimately, after training, I got a fair 64.54 mph on average. 
4. Explored a simulation of Reinforcement Learning applied autonomously in Flappy Bird game.

Day 1:
----------
Halfway into finishing the introduction to deep learning lesson of the Deep Learning Nanodegree.

I was late in starting the course. But as the old saying goes, it is better late than never. I am committed into finishing 30DaysofUdacity initiative from this day forward and I hope to dedicate at least 15 hours per week to my learning journey.
